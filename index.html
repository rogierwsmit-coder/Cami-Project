    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      CAMI is a wearable personal safety platform created to increase the sense of safety for women in public spaces. The product combines a body-worn device (camera, sensors, alarm) with a mobile app and a subscription service. CAMI focuses not only on incident response, but especially on prevention, peace of mind, and direct support when a situation escalates.<br><br>
      It is privacy-by-design. Recordings are visible, temporary (rolling buffer max 48 hours), and strictly meant for personal safety and incident evidence. AI is used as a supportive detection layer (e.g., aggression or stress patterns), without autonomous decisions or biometric identification. CAMI is fully GDPR-compliant and aligns with recent European legal standards.<br><br>
      CAMI is not a surveillance tool or emergency service. It is an empowerment tool: users stay in control and always have direct support within reach.<br><br>
      The product is built as a scalable, sustainable subscription platform, where long-term value lies in the software, AI, and cloud infrastructure rather than the hardware alone.
